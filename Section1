Integrating Data Visualization with an Expense Tracking Application

visualization features by covering the following topics:
Introducing MERN Expense Tracker
Adding expense records
Visualizing expense data over time

Lecture 1:
Introducing MERN Expense Tracker
--The MERN Expense Tracker application will allow users to keep track of their day-today
expenses. Users who are signed in to their accounts will be able to add their
expense records with details such as expense description, category, amount, and
when the given expense was incurred or paid. The application will store these
expense records and extract meaningful data patterns to give the user a visual
representation of how their expense habits fare as time progresses.

--We will add new React components to implement views for creating expense records,
listing and modifying already recorded expenses, and displaying reports giving
insights into expenses incurred by a user over time. We will also modify existing
components such as the Home component to render an overview of current expenses
by a user.

Adding expense records::
--In the MERN Expense Tracker application, a user who is signed in will be able to
create and manage their expense records. To enable these features of adding and
managing expense records, we will need to define how to store expense details, and
implement the full-stack slices that will let users create new expenses, view these
expenses, and update or delete existing expenses on the application.

Lecture 2:
Defining an Expense model::
---We will implement a Mongoose model to define an Expense model for storing the
details of each expense record.
--The Expense schema in this model will have simple fields to store details about each
expense, such as a title, the amount, category, and date when it was incurred, along
with a reference to the user who created the record.
