Lecture 1:
Visualizing expense data over time::
--Aside from allowing users to keep logs of their expenses, the MERN Expense Tracker
application will process the collected expense data to give users insights into their
spending habits over time. We will implement simple data aggregation and
visualization features to demonstrate how the MERN stack can accommodate such
requirements in any full-stack application. To enable these features, we will utilize
MongoDB's aggregation framework and also the React-based charting and data
visualization library—Victory—by Formidable

--In the following sections, we will first add features to summarize a user's expenses in
the current month and also show how they are doing compared to previous months.
Then, we will add different Victory charts to give them a visual representation of
their spending patterns over a month, and a year, and per expense category.

Summarizing recent expenses::
--When a user signs in to their account on the application, they will see a preview of the
expenses they incurred so far in the current month. They will also see a comparison of
how much more or less they are spending in each category in comparison to the
averages from previous months. To implement these features, we will have to add
backend APIs that will run aggregation operations on the relevant expense data in the
database and return the computed results to be rendered in the frontend

Previewing expenses in the current month::
--After a user signs in to the application, we will show a preview of their current
expenses, including their total expenditure for the current month and how much they
spent on the current date and the day before
